### Fair Market Value of Housing in the US 2013: Using Biennial Data from 2011 to Predict the Value of Homes

#### Introduction

The housing market in the US saw dramatic changes as a result of the Financial Crisis of 2008, triggered by the mass default in sub-prime mortgages. By 2013, housing prices seemed to be picking up again as the worst of the crisis had passed due to various interventions by the US government. This rebound in the housing market allowed for the opportunity to explore housing prices in 2013, when the market was rebounding, based on conditions two years earlier in 2011, when the market was bottoming out. The analysis was conducted for Rice University Capstone project in online speciality for Business Statistics and Analysis.
